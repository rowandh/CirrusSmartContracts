Room Thermostat Sample - Stratis Platform C# Contract
====================================================

Preface
---------
This is a C# port of a sample contract from the [Azure Workbench Applications and Smart Contract Samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/blockchain/tree/master/blockchain-workbench/application-and-smart-contract-samples) project.

Overview 
---------

The room thermostat scenario expresses a workflow around thermostat installation and use. In this scenario, a person will install a thermostat and indicate who is the intended user for the thermostat. The assigned user can do things such as set the target temperature and set the mode for the thermostat.

| Created | Indicates that a thermostat installation has been requested. |
| InUse | Indicates that the thermostat is in use. |


Workflow Details
----------------

The room thermostat is a simple workflow to demonstrate how to use the enum data type. Once the installer has installed and started the thermostat, the user can take two main actions. As a user, you can set the target temperature to a temperature you specify, or you can set the mode to one of four modes: Off, Cool, Heat, and Auto.
